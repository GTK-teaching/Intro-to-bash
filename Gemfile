# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:

gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3.2"

gem "jekyll-remote-theme"

gem "jekyll-paginate"

gem "jekyll-sitemap"

# Windows and JRuby does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# and associated library.
platforms :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin, :jruby do
  gem "tzinfo", ">= 1", "< 3"
  gem "tzinfo-data"
end

gem "http_parser.rb", "~> 0.6.0", :platforms => [:jruby]


# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
end


gem "csv"
gem "base64"
gem "bigdecimal"
